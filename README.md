===============

A small project for my sister to learn the basics of web development over winter break. 

As the ultra haute fusion food scene gets more and more competitive, chefs and restaurateaurs need to get more creative and edgy with their dishes and recipes. The days when unsuspecting customers would drop hundreds of dollars on something like "Truffle Bacon Mac and Cheese" are long gone. These days, diners want to eat "Ethiopian Lime Curry" or "Nepalese Kobe Beef Baos".

You've been hired by the Wang Restaurant Group to create a website that will generate food ideas for the chefs to try out. The website will have a button, and everytime someone clicks on the button, a new idea will be displayed. All of the recipe ideas will be of the form "It's like <dish> except <demonym> and with more <ingredient>". For example, clicking on the button might generate "It's like Chicken Pot Pie, except Chinese and with more Blueberries." GENIUS!

As your project manager, I've added basic lists of dishes, demonyms, and ingredients, and I will probably add to these lists in the future.

FAQ
============
How do I build a web application? 
I would suggest using Flask (Python) or Sinatra (Ruby) and checking out the tutorials/quickstarts for those projects.

Why can't I use Django/Rails/Node.js/<insert framework here>?
This project should be very small, so a micro framework that doesn't get in the way of the basic concepts seems to be most preferable. Also, you already know Python, so it should be easiest to get started in something that already uses Python (Flask), or a similar language such as Ruby (Sinatra).

What if I think this project is stupid?
Well, an alternate idea would be a technobabble generator (like http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2526). Would you like that better?

Does the website need to be pretty?
Yes, what are we, animals? Plus, you're interested in design aren't you?
